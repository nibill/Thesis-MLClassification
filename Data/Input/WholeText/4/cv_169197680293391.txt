"Everyone rushes through life looking for their perfect partner, perfect body, perfect job. We're not prepared to make compromises anymore, because we have unlimited choices that make us even more insatiable. We're globally better connected than ever before, and yet our hearts ache from loneliness. Instead of enjoying life, we virtually chase it on the screens of our smartphones." - Samu Haber
It's this recognised disease of civilisation that Sunrise Avenue tackle musically on their fifth album "Heartbreak Century" ( release date: 06.10.2017 ) . It's a return to real values, real feelings and real, genuine pop-rock. Together with three different producers, Samu Haber (vocals, guitar), Raul Ruutu (bass) Sami Osala (drums), Riku Rajamaa (guitar) worked on "Heartbreak Century" for almost twelve months. In addition to long-standing, regular producer Jukka Immonen, tracks were recorded in Berlin, Helsinki and Stockholm with Nicolas Rebscher from Germany (Adel Tawil, Alice Merton) and 25-year-old Swede, Victor Thell (Alessia Cara, Alexander Brown).
Sunrise Avenue will already be back on the road with a sold out HEARTBREAK CENTURY TOUR through Europe in fall 2017. So the Finnish band surrounding Samu Haber is more than motivated to rock the stage and decided to play thirteen additional shows in March 2018!
