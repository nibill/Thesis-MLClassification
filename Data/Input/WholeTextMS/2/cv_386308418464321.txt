This one-time-only concert with Daniel Hope and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra features two SMF favorites, Sebastian Knauer and the Marcus Roberts Trio. Knauer plays works from his 2017 Echo Klassik-winning album, Überbach, a collection of compositions by the Munich-based composer Arash Safaian on themes by Johann Sebastian Bach. In the second half of the program, the Zurich Chamber Orchestra is joined by the Marcus Roberts Trio in performances of Paul Bateman’s stunning arrangements of music by George Gershwin and Kurt Weill.
